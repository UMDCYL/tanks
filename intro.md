# TANKS

Tanks is a game in which you pit your coding abilities against other players.  You write a program for your tank, set it out on the battlefield, and watch how it fares against other tanks while running your program.

Each tank has a turret-mounted laser, two treads, up to ten sensors, and a diagnostic LED.  Sensors are used to detect when other tanks are inside a given arc.  In the examples on this page, "triggered" sensors turn black.  Most tanks will take some action if a sensor is triggered, such as changing speed of the treads, turning the turret, or firing.
